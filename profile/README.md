# GenomicX

**Bioinformatics for everyone. In your browser.**

GenomicX is an open-source community building privacy-first genomic analysis tools powered by WebAssembly. No installs, no servers, no data leaving your machine.

We compile established, peer-reviewed bioinformatics tools into WebAssembly so they run at near-native speed, entirely in the browser. The goal is simple: make everyday genomics tasks as easy as opening a web page.

### Principles

- **Privacy is non-negotiable.** Genomic data is sensitive. Every tool processes data locally. Nothing is uploaded or transmitted.
- **Open source, open science.** All code is public. All methods are transparent. Science built on GenomicX tools is reproducible by anyone.
- **Accessibility over complexity.** If a tool requires a manual to get started, we haven't finished building it.
- **Community-driven.** Feature requests, bug reports, new tools, documentation improvements — every contribution matters.

### Get Involved

- **Use the tools** — open a browser and start analysing
- **Report bugs or request features** — open an issue on any repo
- **Contribute code** — fork, improve, and open a pull request
- **Port a tool** — help bring your favourite command-line bioinformatics tool to the browser
- **Spread the word** — share with colleagues, students, or your lab
